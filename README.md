# Hasty
## Hasty is an online web application that simplifies the process of moving military members worldwide, using the latest and most sophisticated technology stack.

** Hasty is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide snippets of my code. This repository contains .NET, and React code. **

With Hasty, military members and their families can easily manage their moves, track their shipments, and stay informed every step of the way.

My role as a software engineer was to setup an appointment scheduling component to facilitate smooth communication between landlords and site users, as well as, code the customer loyalty program that dynamically displays based upon the users role in the site.

• Integrated an email service powered by SendInBlue by utilizing React.js, C#, .NET framework, and RESTful APIs.

• Designed and built a RESTful API using the .NET framework, which included creating an API authentication system to securely retrieve analytics data on the server-side.

• Tested API functionality using Postman to ensure that endpoints and requests were working properly to avoid potential bugs or errors before deployment.

• Generated data tables and stored procedures to handle data manipulation throughout the application by using joins, FK relationships, UDTs, Batch inserts, and sub-queries for best clarity and efficiency for stored information.

• Used Git and GitHub for source control and repo management.
